## How it will work
> To create virtual environment and clone everything is [here](https://github.com/officialtech/Django-Starters#readme)

> You have to install all docker dependencies, you can get that from [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

* We will use a channel layer that uses Redis as its backing store. To start a Redis server on port 6379, run the following command:

` sudo docker run -p 6379:6379 -d redis:5 `
